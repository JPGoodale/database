    NorthPole signifies a pioneering advancement in chip architecture, delivering
    substantial enhancements in energy, space, and time efficiency. Employing the
    ResNet-50 model as a benchmark, NorthPole showcases significantly superior
    efficiency compared to typical 12-nm GPUs and 14-nm CPUs. Notably, NorthPole itself
    is constructed using 12 nm node processing technology. In both cases, NorthPole
    exhibits a remarkable 25-fold improvement in energy efficiency, measured in terms of
     frames processed per joule of power consumed. Furthermore, NorthPole excels in
     terms of latency and computational footprint, specifically in frames processed per
     second per billion transistors utilized. It is important to highlight that, on the
     ResNet-50 model, NorthPole outperforms all major contemporary architectures, even
     those utilizing more advanced technology processes, such as a GPU built on a 4 nm
     process.

  features:
    - "Energy efficient."
    - "Excels in terms of latency and computational footprint"
