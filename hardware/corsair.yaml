  description: "Corsair hardware involves a groundbreaking technique that shifts computational tasks into Static Random Access Memory (SRAM), fundamentally transforming the interaction between memory and computing. Corsair utilizes a distinctive DIMC engine, consisting of tailored digital circuits, to seamlessly integrate computing functionalities within programmable memory. Corsair achieves this by introducing a multiplying component through the incorporation of four additional transistors into a 6T SRAM bit cell. The most important part of the chip design is the DIMC engine which is a digital version of in-memory compute."

  features:
    - "Optimized for generative inference."
    - "Frictionless and Scalable."
    - "software easily integrates into inference servers."
