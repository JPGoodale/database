  description: "Tesla Dojo is a supercomputer designed and built by Tesla for computer vision video processing and recognition. It will be utilized to train Tesla's machine learning models, enhancing its Full Self-Driving (FSD) advanced driver-assistance system. Dojo operates using its own arithmetic formats and methods. This standard defines Tesla's arithmetic formats and methods for the new 8-bit and 16-bit binary floating-point arithmetic in computer programming environments for deep learning neural network training."

  features:
    - "Dojo operates using its own arithmetic formats and methods."
    - "Dojo is architected to accelerate itself and not have some outboard device do it."
    - "Dojo runs PyTorch. Nothing as low level as C or C++, nothing remotely like CUDA."
