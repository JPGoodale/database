  description: "SparseML is an open source library developed and maintained by [Neural Magic](https://neuralmagic.com/) for applying compression recipes to neural networks.
  Currently, it supports pruning, quantization and knowledge distillation for compressing Vision, NLP, and now, large language models as well.
  SparseML also provides pre-compressed and pre-quantized models in their SparseZoo."
