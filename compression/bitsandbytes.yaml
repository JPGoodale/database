  description: "The bitsandbytes is a lightweight wrapper around CUDA custom functions,
                 in particular 8-bit optimizers, matrix multiplication (LLM.int8()),
                 and quantization functions."
 
  features:
    - "8 Bit Weight Only Quantization"
    - "Support for QLora Finetuning through NF4 dtype"
    - "Calibration free Zero Shot Quantization"
