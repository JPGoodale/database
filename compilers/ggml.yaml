  description: "GGML is a minimal, C-based tensor library focussed on providing efficient training and inference for popular models on commodity hardware, specifically Apple silicon. It has a number of features that make it ideal for edge deployment such as integer quantization ranging from 8-bit quantization all the way to 4-bit, no third-party dependencies, zero memory allocations at runtime, and support for WebAssembly and WASM SIMD for running in the browser. "

  features:
    - "Optimized for Apple Silicon"
    - "Robust quantization support"
    - "No third-party dependencies"
    - "Efficient on-device inference"
